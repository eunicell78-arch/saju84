# Streamlit Secrets Configuration Example
# 
# This file shows the structure for secrets.toml
# DO NOT commit the actual secrets.toml file with real API keys!
#
# For Streamlit Cloud deployment:
# 1. Go to your app dashboard on Streamlit Cloud
# 2. Click on "Settings" → "Secrets"
# 3. Add your secrets in TOML format:

# OpenAI API Key
# Get your API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-your-openai-api-key-here"

# For local development:
# 1. Copy this file to .streamlit/secrets.toml
# 2. Replace the placeholder with your actual API key
# 3. Make sure .streamlit/secrets.toml is in .gitignore
